The purpose of a framework is to provide a shortcut that yields the same conceptual results as a more complex and energy intensive way of thinking. There are too many frameworks out there, so why not combine many of them and create a mega version to solve a problem? It looks dumb and probably is, but here you found a fearless guy trying to do dumb things. 
    
This guide is heavily inspired by Stephen Downes' guide to logical fallacies. I first learned about Stephen two decades ago while researching learning models, and I was amazed by his contributions to Connectivism at that time. Years later, I became genuinely interested in fallacies and then I discovered a guide which is a valuable resource on the topic. To my surprise, Downes was the author. Sometimes a framework is just a good accepted fallacy.
